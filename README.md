# Magic-Wand
In this project we have built a magic wand game system based on Raspberry Pi. First, the user is instructed to deliver a spell either “Wingardium Leviosa” “Stupefy” or “Lumos” and wave the wand in a certain pattern either “down-left”, “up-left”, or “up-right”. If both the spell and the wand gesture is operated correctly, a video showing the corresponding movie scenes where the leading character is casting the spell will be played on the piTFT screen.
